# TestRail âž¡ Testomat.io Migration Script

This script migrates test cases from TestRail to [Testomat.io](https://testomat.io) via API.

You are free to customize this script if the default behavior doesn't fit your needs.

## Set Up Locally

* Ensure **NodeJS 20+** is installed
* Clone this repository
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

```
cp .env.example .env
```

* Fill in TestRail credentials into `.env` file
* Create [General Token](https://app.testomat.io/account/access_tokens) in Testomat.io
* Fill in Testomat.io credentials into `.env` file

```
TESTOMATIO_TOKEN=testomat_****
TESTOMATIO_PROJECT=**
```

> `TESTOMATIO_PROJECT` is a project URL part, e.g. for `https://app.testomat.io/projects/your-project` it is `your-project`

* Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

* Run script

```
npm start
```

## Debugging

To enable more verbose output you can add debug flags via `DEBUG=` environment variable:

* `DEBUG="testomatio:testrail:in"` - print all data coming from TestRail
* `DEBUG="testomatio:testrail:out"` - print all data posting to Testomat.io
* `DEBUG="testomatio:testrail:migrate"` - print all data processing
* `DEBUG="testomatio:testrail:*"` - print all debug information

```
DEBUG="testomatio:testrail:*" npm start
```

## Customization

We keep this repository public, so you could customize the data you import.

Update `migrate.js` script to customize how sections, suites, and cases are obtained. You can customize the way how steps are transformed or test descriptions.

Update the following file and run the script.

### Importing a Single Test Case

For debugging purposes, you can import or re-import a single test case from TestRail by setting the `TESTRAIL_CASE_ID` environment variable. This is useful when you want to test or refine the migration process for a specific test case that might not have been imported correctly during a full migration.

Run the script with the environment variable:
```
TESTRAIL_CASE_ID=12345 npm start
```

To debug importing of this test case add DEBUG flag:

```
DEBUG="*" TESTRAIL_CASE_ID=12345 npm start
```

**Note:** It is important to use this feature for debugging or improving the script *after* an initial full migration has been performed. When `TESTRAIL_CASE_ID` is set, the script will only process that single test case and then exit.

### Test Runs

To migrate test runs with their results, you need to use a **Project-level API token** from Testomat.io. This is different from the personal API token used for migrating test cases. You can find this token in your project settings under the "API" section.

Set the `TESTOMATIO_REPORT_TOKEN` environment variable to this value.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm run migrate-run-results
```

This will migrate all test runs from the TestRail project specified in your `.env` file, along with their test results (passed, failed, skipped). It will skip runs that have already been imported by checking for a special `@id:<run_id>` tag in the run title.

All cases must be imported before run migration started.

## Troubleshooting

* **Duplucation of steps in test cases**

This is can happen if the template of the testcase changed and TestRail keeps data from both templates. Switch to branch `opt/template-fields-sync` to handle this case. See: https://github.com/testomatio/migrate-testrail/pull/6 

```
git checkout opt/template-fields-sync
npm statr
```
